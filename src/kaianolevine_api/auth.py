"""Authentication and authorization — a conformant identity enforcement point.

This module used to carry its own Clerk verification: JWKS fetch and cache,
RS256 decode, M2M opaque verification via Clerk BAPI. Its own docstring said
what to do when a second service needed the same logic —

    "If a second service ever needs to verify Clerk tokens, upstream this
     logic ... and convert this module into a thin consumer rather than
     copying it."

A second enforcement point now exists, so that is what happened. Verification
lives in ``identity.clerk``; the decision lives in ``identity.policy``; the
store lives in ``identity.store``. What remains here is what the contract says
should remain in a service: configuration, and thin FastAPI adapters.

``require_scope(...)`` is the only guard: verify, resolve, authorize, emit
audit, once per request. The earlier dependencies it replaced
(``get_current_caller``, ``require_wcs_admin``, ``require_wcs_service``) are
gone — they encoded authority in a boolean column and in the shape of a token,
which is what roles and scopes now express properly.

Three routes are authenticated-only — a verified credential, no scope — and
this is the whole list (ecosystem-standards AUTH-003):

  POST /v1/wcs/me         where a person first becomes known. It cannot
                          require a principal in order to grant one.
  GET  /v1/wcs/me         reads only the caller's own profile, via
                          ``get_current_owner``, which survives for these
                          two and nowhere else.
  GET  /v1/identity/whoami  reports what verify and resolve saw about the
                          caller and authorizes nothing. Requiring a scope
                          to discover your own identity would make it
                          useless for the case it exists to serve: a caller
                          that has no principal yet.

Any route added to that list needs a reason of the same shape — requiring a
scope would be circular — and needs adding here.
