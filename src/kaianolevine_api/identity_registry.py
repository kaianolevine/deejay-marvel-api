"""Declared machine principals — the source of truth for who the cogs are.

Adding a machine to the fleet is a code change here and nothing else. No
manual seeding, no database access, no script run against production. The
declaration below is reconciled into the principal store on every boot, so a
deploy is what applies it.

Revocation is a code change too: delete the entry, or remove a role from one,
and the next deploy takes the grant away. That is the point of declaring it
rather than seeding it — the grant lives in git, reviewable and reversible,
instead of in whatever state someone left the database in.

Two deliberate limits on what reconciliation touches:

  * Only machines. Human principals are backfilled from wcs_user_profiles and
    granted through the admin UI; a code deploy must never silently re-grant
    or revoke a person's access.

  * Only grants it made itself. Role rows carry ``granted_by``, and
    reconciliation only ever removes rows it wrote (``identity_registry``).
    A role granted by hand for a one-off is left alone rather than being
    quietly reverted by the next unrelated deploy.

Machines are declared by **name**, and the name is the whole identity. Each
holds an API key of its own, kept in deployment configuration, and presenting
that key is what proves the name. Nothing is asserted by the caller and
nothing has to be discovered at runtime, so every declared machine's principal
can exist before it ever makes a request.

Key material is never stored here or in the database. This file says which
machines exist and what they may do; configuration says what proves them.
