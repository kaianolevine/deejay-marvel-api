"""WCS sources router — POST /v1/wcs/sources.

Called by transcription-cog after extracting a transcript. Creates the
wcs_sources row, writes the new active wcs_source_extractions row, and
runs the Composition Service synchronously to derive canonical-layer
rows before returning.

# Synchronous composition (deliberate)

Composition runs in the request lifecycle — the endpoint does not return
until canonical-layer rows are written. This is a proof-of-concept-scale
choice. Reasons:

  - Simplicity: callers (transcription-cog) get a deterministic
    "canonical layer is current" guarantee on 200 response. No follow-up
    polling, no eventual-consistency caveats in downstream readers.
  - Atomicity: source + extraction + canonical rows commit in one
    transaction. Composition failure rolls the whole write back, so the
    DB never holds an extraction without its derived canonical rows.
  - Corpus size: ~100 sources at scale, each composing in well under a
    second. The synchronous cost is invisible at this scale.

# When to revisit

Move composition to a background task (Prefect flow, FastAPI BackgroundTask,
or a deferred queue) if any of these become true:

  - Composition for a single source exceeds ~2 seconds, making the POST
    feel slow to transcription-cog's flow.
  - Bulk re-composition (e.g. after a global name correction) needs to
    fan out across many sources; doing that synchronously inside a single
    request blocks the worker.
  - The endpoint moves to a context where the caller can't tolerate
    request-level coupling to composition (e.g. user-facing UI ingestion).

Until one of those triggers, synchronous composition is the right call.
The cost of moving to async later is small: change compose_source's
invocation from ``await compose_source(...)`` to a task enqueue, and add
a status field on wcs_source_extractions to track composition state.
